          <p>Can my group meet at the church?</p>

          <p>
            LifeGroups are meant for doing life together. When groups meet at
            the church it begins to reflect another church service which can
            break down some of the intimacy that comes with meeting in homes. If
            your group becomes too big to meet in a house then it is time to
            multiply, rather than finding a bigger space. Furthermore, meeting
            at the church ties up the building in case it needs to be used for
            other purposes as well. If something comes up and a group needs to
            meet there for a week or two that is okay, but we do not want groups
            meeting there as a long term solution.

            Can I bring in a Non-Lifestone person to speak or talk on something
            during group time?

          <p>
            Everything that is taught needs to be approved by the leadership.
            Even if it is someone we all know and love, please ask permission
            first. If there are theological questions that need to be answered
            then please go up the ladder of leadership which is Ashley Smith,
            who oversees all LifeGroups, and then Pastor Ben.

            How do I care for my whole group when I naturally connect to only a
            few?
          </p>

          <p>
            At times it can be a struggle to care for people. There will be some
            people that you will connect with naturally and some people that you
            won't connect with. The answer isn't equal time, but it is equal
            care. We are all different and are naturally drawn to certain
            personalities. This isn't sinful or bad leadership, it is just life
            and how we build community for ourselves. As a leader, we have to be
            aware of our tendency to connect to only a few and constantly ask
            ourselves "How are we caring for others in our group?". Remember,
            there are five common ways that people receive love: quality time,
            acts of service, receiving gifts, touch, words of encouragement. Try
            some different methods out on those you have a harder time
            connecting with and see how they respond. You will notice that they
            will likely respond to one greater than the others.

            I have people in my group that I think will be great leaders. What
            do I do?
          </p>

          <p>
            As shepherd, we should always be observant to what the Lord is doing
            in the lives of our group members and praying for the next
            generation of leaders. When you identify a potential lifegroup
            leader then start giving them more responsibility in your group.
            Perhaps you could ask them to do the opening prayer, ice breaker, or
            plan an event for the group. Once you gained confidence in your
            potential leaders, please share their progress with Ashley Smith
            (LifeGroup Coach). We will then move forward with additional
            conversations and training.

          <p>My group is getting too big. What do I do?</p>

          <p>
            Multiply! We use the word 'multiply' on purpose. We want to refrain
            from using the word 'dividing' because with division there is no
            growth. By multiplying, we are providing more space for those that
            are needing a lifegroup family. At Lifestone, we want to see our
            growth come from inviting new people. As your group grows larger,
            your job as a lifegroup leader is to continually be evaluating new
            potential leaders. Part of this process is to prepare and equip them
            so that they can lead a group when the time is right. Having these
            new leaders ready will allow the multiplication process to occur
            more naturally. It takes purposeful relationships to build up new
            leaders and to keep multiplication fresh on your group's mind. (This
            is an overview. Please talk to your Lifegroup Coach - Ashley Smith
            before talking to anyone about leading a lifegroup)

            Why can't my group choose their own study or not have a lesson at
            all.
          </p>

          <p>
            We need to start groups with some basic structure as we are training
            up new leaders. Having a set lesson is a reproducible way to equip
            them. We believe in giving the Holy Spirit permission to take the
            group where it needs to go regardless of where you start. It is
            similar to Sunday morning. Ben prepares a sermon and the worship
            team rehearses songs so everyone knows the flow of the service, but
            room is always left for the Holy Spirit to work. For example, the
            Holy Spirit may prompt the band may do an extra song that wasn't on
            the set list or someone may spontaneously come forward to get
            baptized (as we have recently seen, Praise Jesus!). We fully believe
            in and support our lifegroup leaders and understand that the lesson
            will be taught through the filter of their life experiences and the
            needs of their group. You are a highly valued shepherd! The lesson
            isn't intended to be a rigid structure that creates uniformity in
            every single group. Instead, it serves as a guide to open the Bible
            and share your life. It is also good to remember that some
            connections should happen outside of scheduled lifegroup time. There
            will be seasons where the leaders can choose a study for their
            group. This can be a great way to produce great fruit in both the
            leader and their lifegroup. Whichever season the church is in, we
            ask that you trust us in our decisions for curriculum. We value each
            of your individual opinions and it is our desire to hear from the
            Lord on what He is wanting to teach Lifestone as a whole.
