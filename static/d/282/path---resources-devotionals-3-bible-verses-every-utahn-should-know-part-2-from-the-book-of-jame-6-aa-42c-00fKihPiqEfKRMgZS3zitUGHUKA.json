James gives some simple commands to fix the problem:</p>\n<p>Listen to these words James commands and gives to the brothers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit to God, resist the Devil - 4:7</li>\n<li>Draw near to God, He will draw near to you - 4:8</li>\n<li>Cleanse your hands, sinners - 4:8</li>\n<li>Purify your hearts, double minded - 4:8</li>\n<li>Be miserable, Mourn, Weep, Change your laughter to mourning - 4:9</li>\n<li>Humble yourselves before the Lord - 4:10</li>\n<li>Don’t criticise one another - 4:11</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don’t sense James solution is to do a bunch of good works to compensate for treating poor people with disrespect. If our church decided to help fund a shopping area for rich people in Herriman or Riverton just blocks from where poor people huddle in city parks, James would tell us our friendship is with the world. Jesus said, in Matthew 7:16 that you can know people by their fruit.</p>\n<p>The tendency of worldly people will be to show they do a lot for the poor while appeasing the rich. James public relations solution is not a list of foreign countries they help in crisis but an attitude of submitting to God to purify our hands and heart for service to others in need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will we accept (humbly receive) the implanted Word (Old and New Testament)?</li>\n<li>Will we ask for God’s perspective if we do not understand?</li>\n<li>Will we see the “new birth” of James 1:18 as a gift from God or will we take credit for the decisions and good works we have done apart from God’s grace?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just so we are clear that God is not teaching anything different in James 2:24: read the following passages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Because by works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight...” (Rom. 3:20)</li>\n<li>“For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law” (Rom. 3:28)</li>\n<li>“But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.” (Rom. 4:5)</li>\n<li>“know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ. And we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no human being will be justified.” (Galatians 2:16)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Bible Study principle of reading in context is essential for Bible students to discover and use.\nOne idea is called the 20/20 vision concept of reading 20 verses before and 20 verses after the Bible passage in question to see and understand what is going on. Although this principle would have helped a little in understanding James 2:24 the real understanding comes from taking the entire book as a whole to see what is being taught in a concise manner.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James 5:19-20</p>\n<p>My brothers, if any among you strays from the truth, and someone turns him back, let him know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his life from death and cover a multitude of sins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Should we disregard the Psalms because David was a polygamist who murdered and committed adultery? Just remember the key to David writing many of the Psalms, he repented and was declared righteous by God (Psalm 51 and Psalm 32). Both David and Abraham are great examples that we are declared righteous by God because we have received the implanted Word and gained God’s perspective by listening to what He says to us today when His Living Word (Hebrews 4:12) speaks and we confess and agree with God.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Romans 10:9</p>\n<p>If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},"title":"3 Bible Verses Every Utahn Should Know: Part 2 From the Book of Jame","author":[{"id":"ef7bd1b1-c63a-54dc-9ffe-db36e1bb7217","name":"Sam Coleman","photo":null}],"date":"2017-05-11"}},"pageContext":{"id":"fb849094-152e-5387-9ecd-1b727d79d116"}}
