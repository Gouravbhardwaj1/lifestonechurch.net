For example, if we listed the character qualities of those closest to us chances are you would be able to think back on your time with them and see how much your understanding of who they are has grown. The same is true in how we grow in knowing God. As you look at the characteristics of God below, which, if any, have you seen grow or change in your own understanding and appreciation of who God is?</p>\n<p>Love, Grace, Forgiveness, Kindness, Justice, Other.</p></li>\n<li><p>Knowing and understanding God's ultimate power in our life and our world makes a big difference in how we live out the hope we have in following him.
