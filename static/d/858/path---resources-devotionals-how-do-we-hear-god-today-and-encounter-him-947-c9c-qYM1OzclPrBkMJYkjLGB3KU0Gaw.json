When the Spirit of truth comes, he [the Holy Spirit] will guide you into all the truth, for he [the Holy Spirit] will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He [the Holy Spirit] will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ephesians 1:13-14</p>\n<p>In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Questions to think about:</p>\n<p>Psalm 119:32 What does it look like for God to enlarge our hearts? Notice the Psalmist says he will run in the way of God’s commandments after this enlargement takes place.</p>\n<p>The LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 1 Kings 11:9</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>John 12:28-29</p>\n<p>Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The people in John 12 explained God’s voice away by saying it had thundered, Solomon’s heart did not get bigger for God but smaller till it had turned away and that was after physically encountering God twice.</p>\n<p>What benefit would we have in seeing and hearing God speak to us directly/physically instead of using His active and living Word (Hebrews 4:12) and the power and presence of the Holy Spirit?</p>\n<p>We are of the mindset if God just showed up in more powerful ways and a speaking voice and a clearer presentation of the gospel more people would be convinced and believe - this was not the case in the time of Elijah or Elisha (many many miracles done - yet no nationwide revival) or even in the time of Moses with a constant variety of demonstrations of God’s power met with more unbelief and rebellion. Will we be satisfied with letting God’s Word be our place of encountering God through the Holy Spirit?</p>\n<p>Peter talks about seeing Jesus transform on the Mount of transfiguration and hearing the voice of the Father from heaven speak and being an “eyewitness” (2 Peter 1:16) to these events. Then he talks about something more reliable, more fully confirmed in 2 Peter 1:19 and that is the prophetic Word of God, the Bible.</p>\n<p>And we heard this voice when it came from heaven while we were with Him on the holy mountain. So we have the prophetic word strongly confirmed. You will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dismal place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all, you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. 2 Peter 1:18-21</p>\n<p>Our hearts (feeling, emotions, thoughts, desires) are compared to a dark and dismal place in 2 Peter 1:19. How many times do you hear people confirm belief based on a testimony of, “I know in my heart of hearts” or I feel and sense this is right? Jesus taught If you don’t believe God’s Word (Moses and the Prophets) then you are not going to believe or “be convinced” if someone should rise from the dead . . . this gets proven after Lazarus has been dead for 4 days - people refused to believe Jesus.</p>\n<p><strong>Jesus did emphatically teach the Old Testament was more powerful a testimony of God than a dead man risen and visiting you.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Luke 16:29-31</p>\n<p>But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ He said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today we encounter a whole group of people who believe in the resurrection of Lazarus and the resurrection of Jesus but they doubt the authenticity of the Word of God because of the presence of a modern day prophet who contradicts Jesus in many places.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 Cor. 2:12</p>\n<p>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When you understand the things freely given by God your testimony changes from I know in my heart of hearts to I know because God, who is faithful said so and I confess my sin and acknowledge Jesus is the only complete way my sin is dealt with on the cross (Colossians 1:20) so that I can be declared righteous and holy and have peace with God.</p>\n<p>I have sometime sensed in my own life I believe because I simply see many people around me believing and as a large group we can not be wrong, the truth is having thousands or even millions of people around you believing the same stuff does not make it truth. We need to question what we believe and test it to see if we are in the faith (2 Cor. 13:5). When our testimony of salvation in part is based on what I do or even in even my work of believing then there will never be assurance of salvation and abundant joy. When I completely trust Jesus and His Word over anyone else’s opinion, I now have what David would call an enlarged heart toward God or abundant joy in God’s Holy Presence. This leads to a revealed path of life and eternal pleasures in who God is. Our destination is not only heaven later but God’s eternal presence now when we open our Bibles and let God begin to speak to us.</p>\n"},"title":"How Do We Hear God Today and Encounter Him?","author":[{"id":"ef7bd1b1-c63a-54dc-9ffe-db36e1bb7217","name":"Sam Coleman","photo":null}],"date":"2017-06-22"}},"pageContext":{"id":"c3a8d2e6-f288-5b07-9b8d-115e778ea0ff"}}
