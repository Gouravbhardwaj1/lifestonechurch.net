If we look at the verses before and the verses after James 2:24 we get a better sense of what is going on, James is writing to “my brothers” (James 2:1) about a problem they are having showing “favoritism” to rich people while dishonoring poor people. James saw this as “evil” thinking (James 2:4) comparing it with murder and adultery. In James 2 he reminds us if we break one law we break all of the law (James 2:10). This “friendship” with the world would be adultery and hostility toward God Himself (James 4:4).</p>\n<p>James teaches a new birth by grace, not by doing the law. James says God chose us and gave us a new birth by the message of the truth. You can not take credit for God’s work to change your heart.</p>\n<h2>#2 James 1:18</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James 1:18</p>\n<p>By His own choice, He gave us a new birth by the message of truth so that we would be the firstfruits of His creatures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the key commands James gives us is to “humbly receive” the implanted word (James 1:21) and the purpose of the law or this word according to James is a “mirror” (James 1:23) that shows us what and who we really are, the person who does the word of God uses the mirror right. The person who looks and quickly forgets does not use the gift of God’s implanted word that reflects God’s character (which has no variation - James 1:16). God is not doing a new thing with the law, He is actually doing an old thing with the law. This is called waking us up to who we really are - dead in our sin (Eph. 2) only the Holy Spirit can convict us and show us through God’s implanted word who we are and who God is (righteous). This begins the process of new birth - you can not give a testimony that you chose God and said yes and made a faith decision according to James, “by His choice” he gave new birth by the message of truth.</p>\n<p>Why do people use James 2:24 to teach you need your own works with Jesus’ help to be saved?</p>\n<h2>#3 James 1:5</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>James 1:5</p>\n<p>Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without criticizing, and it will be given to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wisdom simply is God’s perspective.</p>\n<p>Another part of wisdom is the skill of living out that perspective in God’s grace.</p>\n<p>If you don’t understand that perspective and you want to understand it, pray and ask God to show you who He is as you read the Old Testament. Many Bible scholars believe James may have been the first New Testament book written - this is why James has such a strong appeal for understanding the Old Testament and looking into the Law, at the time there may not have been a Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John to read. Galatians tells us the Law ultimately points to and leads us to Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:24-26).</p>\n<p>This is also why it is way out of context to use James 1:5 as a guide and gauge prayer over other spiritual books that claim insight from God. Imagine if I were a missionary for the FLDS church and knocked on your door and presented you with Warren Jeffs 2012 book: Jesus Christ, Message to All Nations and then asked you to pray James 1:5 to determine its validity? Would you pray that prayer or would you heed Jesus teaching on the absurdity of picking grapes from a thornbush (Matthew 7:16) or as Jesus himself taught... “you will recognize them (false prophets and ravaging wolves) by their fruit” Warren Jeffs was convicted of sexual assault against a 12 and 15 year old, both whom he called his “spiritual wives.” Look into the history of people who claim to be prophets - is there evidence and indication of thornbush like tendencies? Then do not use that as a source for nourishment and grapes and definitely don’t use James 1:5 to ask for the validity of a thornbush prophet.</p>\n"},"title":"3 Bible Verses Every Utahn Should Know","author":[{"id":"ef7bd1b1-c63a-54dc-9ffe-db36e1bb7217","name":"Sam Coleman","photo":null}],"date":"2017-05-04"}},"pageContext":{"id":"94087717-c310-562f-97af-0e12679537d9"}}
